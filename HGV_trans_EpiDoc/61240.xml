               <milestone n="280" unit="line"/> You go, and I will go and look for Paris, to call him,
<milestone n="280a" unit="line"/>. . . . . carrier of woe? . . . . .
        [if perhaps he wishes] to hear what I have to say. I wish for him the earth
        [would gape right] now; for the Olympian reared him as a great source of pain
        [for the Trojans] and for great-hearted Priam and his children.
        [If I were to see] him having gone down into Hades,
<milestone n="285" unit="line"/>  [I would say] that my own mind had forgotten its painful grief.
       [Thus he spoke,] nor did Hecuba disobey, but quickly called
       [to her maids,] and they gathered together the older women throughout the city.
       [But she went] down to the sweet-smelling chamber,
<milestone n="288a" unit="line"/> [Made of cedar] which contained many noble treasures
<milestone n="288b" unit="line"/> [. . .] queenly among women, she stood beside the chests
        [Where her] many-colored robes were, the work of Sidonian
<milestone n="290" unit="line"/>  [Women, whom] godlike Alexand[er himself]
        [Had led from Sidon] when he sail[ed the wide sea,]
        [That journey on which he brought back He]le[n of the noble father.]
