⳨ In the fourth year of the reign and consulship of our divinissimus lord Flavius Justin the eternal Augustus Emperor, eighth Phaophi of the third indiction in the 
most glorious Antinoopolis.
<milestone n="6" rend="break" unit="line"/> † On the one part Aurelius Theodoros, son of Georgios, from the mother Nonna, hired baker, hailing from the fair city of Antinoopolis, 
<milestone n="12" rend="break" unit="line"/> and on the other part Aurelia Amaresia, 
daughter of Proous, the trader, of the mother Fania, hailing from the same city, conclude and make jointly this written agreement of divorce and separation, 
to each other in two identical copies of this repudium, stated verbatim as follows:
<milestone n="15" unit="line"/> Long ago we were united with each other in marriage and shared life, in good hope and in view of conceiving good legitimate children, believing we would live a peaceful, 
noble married life with each other, during the whole time of our shared life; on the contrary, we do not know how we, beyond expectation, 
suffered by the evil demon having attacked us, to separate from each other. 
For this reason we have resorted to the present repudium acknowledging that we have no claim against each other, presently or in the future, from now and forever, 
concerning any matter written or unwritten, adjudicated or not, 
neither concerning the union of marriage and its bridal gifts and dowry and marriage expenses nor about household utensils which were brought in for each other by each other, 
nor concerning any matter in general, but also that I, the aforementioned Theodoros give up for the kids (we had) so far together with the baby in the womb …
