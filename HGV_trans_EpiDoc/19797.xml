               <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> … On receiving the present letter, therefore, come down to us with all speed, bringing with you the men from your district whom we named to you in our former letters, (5) and in addition a register of places giving the male population in each, with the poll-tax to which they are liable and the amount of each man's holding in land, both vine-land and arable land, and the services he has rendered with instructions and without, and a register of the names and patronymics of the fugitives in each place; (10) in short make clear to us in your register all that you know, not giving any cause of complaint against yourself whatever in this matter. And we have instructed the present messenger not to remain with you more than two (or?) three days, until you come down to us, telling those who come down with you from each (15) place in your district to bring with them the accounts of their place, in order that if we seek information from them on any subject they may be found prepared to tell us all they know and can communicate. You will be aware that we shall not accept from you any ground of excuse whatsoever; therefore do not require another letter from us about this after the present one, (20) lest retribution overtake you which shall destroy your life and property. Written the 12th Phaophi, 8th indiction.
