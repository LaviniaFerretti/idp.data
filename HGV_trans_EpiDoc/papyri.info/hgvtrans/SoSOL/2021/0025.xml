               <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> Maximos to Tinarsieges (her?) sister, many greetings and good health
                      always. If you are coming to your days of giving birth, write to me so that I
                      may come and perform your delivery, since I do not know your month. I
                      wrote to you in advance for this reason, so that you might also act in
                      advance and write to me so that I would come in the provisions boat, so
                      that I too may remain with you and perform your delivery. For I advise you
                      that I am intended to give birth at your house. If you don’t send word to
                      me, you do me no favour. I was going to send you jars for your delivery. I
                      didn’t send them for this reason, so that I might bring them when I come,
                      along with two matia of lupines. The man who is bringing you the ostracon
                      is returning to me. Do not neglect to write by way of him about the house-by-house
                      census. They called your name and they did not call it again (?). I
                      wrote to your brother upriver so that they might also submit your name
                      inside in the [?]. I greet you and Kalleas and all those in the house by name.
                      Send me leaves as for a small basket and I will make it for you … I pray for
                      your health.
