               <item corresp="#lb1" xml:space="preserve"><ref>1</ref> <p>Αδοκλῆς is an otherwise unknown name, found also in 5, but the reading seems certain combining
the two ostraka. The third letter here and there could be epsilon, which would not help and which does not
seem likely in 5. Possibly the name is formed from Hades, and should thus be taken as Ἁδοκλῆς, as I have
rendered it in the translation. But I have found no other instance of this name or any other close to it. It
seems to be declined -ῆς, -ῆτος, rather than -ῆς, -ήους.</p></item>
               <item corresp="#lb2" xml:space="preserve"><ref>2</ref> <p>Since one must take the initial κυρίῳ in the dative, as in many other texts, it seems likely enough that
the name following is that of the addressee and the one after it the addressee’s patronymic. But for what
follows it is impossible to be sure whether the name at the start of line 2 is correctly in the nominative, and
if so why it is followed by another dative. Similar problems are found in 5, but there it appears that the third
name is dative and the last one nominative, offering another set of questions. Here, the second Heraklammon has been taken as intended as patronymic.</p></item>
               <item corresp="#lb3" xml:space="preserve"><ref>3</ref> <p>Barely ghosts of the letters in the central part of this line are preserved.</p></item>
               <item corresp="#lb4" xml:space="preserve"><ref>4</ref> <p>That δημοσίῳ μέτρῳ might be expressed by a writing of only the fi rst word, sometimes abbreviated,
was recognized in <emph rend="italics">O.Douch</emph> 2, p. 87. A writing identical to that here can be found in <emph rend="italics">O.Douch</emph> 3.274.2 and,
from Dakhla, <emph rend="italics">O.Trim.</emph> 1.10.</p></item>
               <item corresp="#lb5" xml:space="preserve"><ref>5-6</ref> <p>The reading is extremely uncertain, but αὐτός seems secure. At the start of line 6 the space seems
more than needed, but tau at the start and sigma before the zeta are suffi ciently clear. Cf. the note to 5, line
5, on this formulation.</p></item>
